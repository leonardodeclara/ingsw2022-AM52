## Project specification
The following projects consists of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) implementation of a distributed system made up of a server and multiple clients.<br>
The server is able to manage multiples games and multiple clients connected through socket connections. <br>
The game can be played through a command line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI). <br>

## Execution

### Jars
Jars can be downloaded from the project folder: [Jars](https://github.com/leonardodeclara/ingsw2022-AM52/tree/master/deliverables/jars).

### Client

#### CLI
Eryantis CLI client can be executed by typing the following command:
```
java -jar AM52-Client.jar -cli
```
In order to properly render CLI elements on Windows OS it is advised to execute the programme on terminals providing emulation for ANSI escape codes for color, such as ConEmu. 

#### GUI
Eryantis GUI client can be executed in three ways:

- by double clicking on  ```AM52-Client.jar```
- by typing the following command:
```
java -jar AM52-Client.jar
```
- by typing the following command:
```
java -jar AM52-Client.jar -gui
```
### Server
In order to execute the game's server the following command is required:
```
java -jar AM52-Server.jar 
```
Then a port number has to be entered in order to start server's execution.
